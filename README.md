# [dolibarr_stocktransfers_module](https://github.com/caos30/dolibarr_stocktransfers_module)

## Description

The objective of this Dolibarr's module is to offer a more friendly interface than the Dolibarr native to transfer products from one warehouse to another of the company that owns Dolibarr. If you have installed the "Purchases" module (also from IMASDEWEB) then in case of lack of stock for the transfer, a button appears to create a new process to purchase the missing stock.

The module allows the download of a PDF file with the list of products to be transferred and space below for the triple signature of the one who makes the shipment, the carrier and the one who will receive the products in the destination warehouse, usual "delivery note" in this type of transportation. 

## Interface language translations

Until now: English / Catalan / Castillian (spanish)
